#  What are negative indexes and why are they used?

Ans.

# Negative indexes in Python are used to access elements from the end of a list(right to left), string.
# While positive indexes count from the start of the sequence (beginning with 0, "left to right"),
# negative indexes count from the end of the sequence (starting with -1 for the last element).

#   #  0 1 2 3  4  5  6      positive index
#  v= [2,5,8,9,23,34,54]
#   # -7 -6 -5 -4  -3  -2  -1      negative index

#   use- 
#     Negative indexes use for access elements relative to the end of the list or string.
