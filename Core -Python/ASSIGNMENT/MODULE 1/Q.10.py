# Write python program that swap two number with temp variable and without temp variable. 

#swap using third variable
# a = 4
# b = 5
# c = a
# print ("value of c is", c)
# a = b
# print (" value of a is ", a)
# b = c
# print ("value of b is", b)

#swap without using third variable
a = 4
b = 5
a = a+b
b=a-b
a = a-b
print (" value of a is ", a)
print ("value of b is", b)
